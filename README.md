# Supply_Chain_Tableau_Dashboard
This project is based on Supply Chain Management of a American Superstore Data.
Through this dataset, we worked on Company Sales and Inventory.
To optimize data in the logistic sector by leveraging data insights. 
With the help of calculated fields, we analyzed and visualized several KPIâ€™s such as Overall sales growth, Top 5 store wise sales, Region sales, Product wise sales, Total Inventory, Total stock status and so on.
Hence, Crafted an interactive dashboard in Tableau to have a clear representation and understanding of the KPI's.
Datas will filter accordingly as per your choice if clicked on one particular visual of a KPI.
With the help of navigation button (ALT + Click) we can access dashboard no. 2, which is, Total sales (Yearly, Quarterly and Monthly).
